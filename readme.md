**README in progress...**

In this small summer project I unified the Fourier animations method discussed in the **michaelnaps/four** repository with the **michaelnaps/mpc** repo to drive a differential drive robot (Roomba) around a curved path in simulation. A more thorough description of the process will be written in the future, but for now an example is shown below...
